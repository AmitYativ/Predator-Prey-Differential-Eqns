# Predator-Prey / Lotka-Volterra Equations

This script is written in Python and utilizes methods of approximating ordinary differential equations such as RK4, Forward Euler, and Adams Predictor Corrector Method to approximate periodic solutions of the Lotka-Volterra Equations. This depicts the change of population through time within a predator-prey relationship, such as rabbits (prey) and foxes (predators), portraying the dynamics of biological systems in which the predator and prey species interact.
